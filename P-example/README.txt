Scripts:

compile: compile project
run: run student version
run-jar: run given solved version
clean: removes compiled files

Note: runjar assumes that pt.ua.gboard and pt.ua.concurrent jar files exist in path /usr/local/java/ext/.
If that is not the case, you can either put those files there, or edit the script to change their path in 
the file system.
